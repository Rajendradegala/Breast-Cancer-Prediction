# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
 Breast cancer prediction can be approached using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset that includes various features related to breast cancer, such as age, tumor size, and lymph node status, a predictive model can be built. 


The suggested method uses a trained deep learning neural network system to categorize breast cancer subtypes. According to data from 221 actual patients, the findings have an accuracy of 90.50 percent. Without needing any human intervention, this model can classify and identify breast cancer lesions.
