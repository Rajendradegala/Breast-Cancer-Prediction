# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
 Breast cancer prediction can be approached using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset that includes various features related to breast cancer, such as age, tumor size, and lymph node status, a predictive model can be built. 


The suggested method uses a trained deep learning neural network system to categorize breast cancer subtypes. According to data from 221 actual patients, the findings have an accuracy of 90.50 percent. Without needing any human intervention, this model can classify and identify breast cancer lesions.

1.DATA  PREPROCESSING:

Data preprocessing is an essential step in working with datasets. It involves cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. This can include handling missing values, removing duplicates, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and more. By preprocessing the data, we can ensure that it is in a format that can be effectively used by machine learning algorithms. It's like preparing the ingredients before cooking a delicious meal! 🍳🥘


The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset is utilized, consisting of various features related to tumor characteristics. The dataset is explored, visualized, and divided into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics.


One method is to remove outliers as a means of trimming the data set. Another method involves replacing the values of outliers or reducing the influence of outliers through outlier weight adjustments. The third method is used to estimate the values of outliers using robust techniques
